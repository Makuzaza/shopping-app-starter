Homework:

Refactor the Cart page to take the cart array from the reduxslice and display a page with all of the items in the cart on it.

You can create this behaviour by considering how the Products page shows all products at the moment from the redux slice.

You can even copy the majority of the code.

Think about how you access the data from the redux store. HINT: useSelector
